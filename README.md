# Strava
Strava repository

This is a repository of Jupyter notebooks and Python 3.5 code used to analyse Strava data for the Science4Performance blog. 

The code will not work without a user access token that must be stored in the working directory as a text file called mktoken.txt. To obtain an access token, see https://strava.github.io/api/
